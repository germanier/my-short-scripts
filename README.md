# hello there

this is where all of my scripts will slowly be stored and added

i do not aim to make them useful for your system, but for myself

i have been distrohopping a lot lately because I keep doing stuff I should instead do in VM's but such is life

i will add my dotfiles here eventually once i customise them

i have been using i3 but have since returned to bspwm. I like this better than i3 but will need to get used to the new configs and do my own thing

i run archcraft-bspwm. its a nice distro for the intermediate user. has two nice riced up wm's!

thank you for passing by
